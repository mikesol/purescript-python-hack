Run python in purescript

# Howto

```bash
npm install
npx spago run
```

You should see the number `3`.

You can mess around with `test.py` and `Main.purs` to change the function.

You can check out the branch `sklearn` to see an example using `scikit-learn`. When using this branch, make sure to set up a virtualenv and `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Have fun!
